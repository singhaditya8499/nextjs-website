I have always wondered whether the choices we make are really ours or is it influenced by the people around us,
our environement or some other third party actions. Consider a situation that you had a dream that you are brushing 
your teeth with Colgate, you wake up while dreaming this. You go to brush your teeth but find that you have pepsodent with you. 
You will use that to brush your teeth but now the question come up if brushing your teeth with pepsodent was actually your 
choice or not. Remember that you woke up dreaming about Colgate which naturally will be in your mind and you would want to 
use Colgate that day (pretty bad example, but understand the emotion).

Consider another example. Many people say that our life is fated from the birth. If this is true does it mean that we are part 
of a play directed by someone else. A thief who was caught by police when he was looting for his family, did he make 
a choice of his own? When you were in 10th standard and decided to pursue Science/Commerce/Arts, did you really make a 
conscious decision?

Even if you dont believe that our life is fated the question still remains. Suppose there is a poor worker(lets call him S), 
the worker's father (let's call him F) was a good man but he was also poor. Right from the beginning, S made choices 
corresponding to the options available to him which was dictated by efforts/work of F. 

Lets take another example. Suppose I ask you to think of a random city. You thought of some city X. Now this name came up 
from your memory without any efforts and I can confortably say this as well that you have lots of other city names in your 
memory. Then how did you came with the name X and not any other name? Is our choice really ours? Is there any free will 
in this world.

I am writing this article, I made a choice to start writing this. But were the choice really mine? I dont think we will ever know!
