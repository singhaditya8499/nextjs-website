Percentage. A term which we use on a daily basis but never pay any emphasis on its importance in our day to day life. According 
to wikipedia percentage is a ratio expressed as a fraction of 100. In ancient Rome, long before decimal came into existence, 
computations were often made in multiples of 1/100. Percentage is also used to compare two values belonging to same family where 
the values might not be equal. Consider two shops selling the same item but at different price and they are offering different percentage 
discount, we can find where we can get the best deal using percentage and its equivalent value.

I think we can extend it beyond mathematics, I like to call it "Percentage thinking". We will see how we can apply in in everyday 
tasks and sometimes in crucial tasks to make better and intelligent thinking. Suppose there is a labour intensive task which is 
performed by two people A and B. 

> Let us assume that in an ideal situation person A can put in effort E<sub>A</sub> and person B 
can put in effort E<sub>B</sub>.

> Without loss of generalization let us assume that E<sub>A</sub> > E<sub>B</sub>

> Now, suppose we know that at any given day (using past data, etc) that person A will put P<sub>A</sub> % effort and person B 
will put P<sub>B</sub> % effort

> By basic, general thinking it would look fair to choose person A over person B as the overall effort by A is greater than B.

> But the total efforts are ideal and the efforts one can put in real world setting will be (effort \*  percentage) which will be 
E<sub>A</sub> \* P<sub>A</sub> for person A and same for B.

Its better to choose the person with higher value of (effort \* percentage) than just looking at effort. Note that we are assuming 
that we know the value of effort one can put in which is an abstract concept. But for the sake of understanding this type of 
thinking let us assume that we know the value of efforts.

Let us extend this to the concept of love. Assume a boy is loved by two girls, the boy also like both the girls and he has to 
choose between the two. 

> Let us call call boy as B and girls as G1 and G2.

> The numerical value (assumption) of the measured love G1 can give is L<sub>G1</sub> and love G2 can give is L<sub>G2</sub>

> Without loss of generality, let us assume that L<sub>G1</sub> > L<sub>G2</sub>

> Ideally, the boy would choose G1 due to higher love value he can get as compared to G2.

> But, this is not true as its possible that total love by G1 is distributed to many people (friends, other boys, etc). So, we 
will introduce another factor called percentage love (PL). 

> Let us assume that G1 will give B a percentage love of PL<sub>G1</sub>

> Let us assume that G2 will give B a percentage love of PL<sub>G2</sub>

**Now, we can make a better and informed decision. **

> We can see the what is the value of L<sub>G1</sub> \* PL<sub>G1</sub>, let us call it LOVE<sub>G1</sub>

> The value of L<sub>G2</sub> \* PL<sub>G2</sub>, let us call it LOVE<sub>G2</sub>

Whoever's got the higher value of LOVE, its best to choose that girl if we are looking from boy B's perspective which might not 
always be the best decision in the long run. Notice that its possible that love present with a person can be large but they 
can still give a lot less love if the percentage distribution is low, particularly  in this scenario.

It should be noted that we are taking many assumptions to implement this thinking process. In theory this does seem right 
and maybe is worthy of a thought.
