>*`Below material was captured as notes, while I was studying Introduction to psychology out of curiosity, a course made available by Yale`.*

## Brain

### Astonishing hypothesis

It was given by Francis Crick, who was one of the discoverer of molecular structure of DNA. He said that

> a person's mental activities are entirely due to the behaviour of nerve cells, glial cells, and the atoms, ions, and molecules that make them up and influence them.

This puts a question in front of us, do we really have control on ourselves or are we just a physical machine who is controlled by some undiscovered power?

### Dualism

**Descartes** said humans are not machine and they have control over themselves, their actions and emotions unlike animal. Humans are a part of **dualism** which consist of a material body and an immaterial mind. He gave two arguments why we are not machine and a part of dualism:

1. Humans can choose what to say, how to react, etc to different situations and questions.
2. The soul is entirely distinct from the body. (He considered brain to be immaterial part of our existence)

But he failed to explain, how humans learn to talk? What makes someone attractive? How is soul connected with material body.

### Neurons

The basic unit of brain is a neuron, basic building block. It is made up of three main parts:

1. Dendrites:  Neurons get signals from other neuron here. It decides whether to fire a neuron or not. It depends on some threshold value.
2. Axon: Firing from dendrites happen here. It can be in feet.
3. Axon terminals: It helps connecting with other neurons.

<><div className="image"><img src="https://doclists.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Neuron-Anatomy-scaled-1.jpg" alt="Neuron" width="500"/></div></>

There are three types of neurons:

1. Sensory neurons (helps in vision, hearing, etc)
2. Motor neurons (helps picking hand up, walking, etc)
3. Inter neurons (helps in thinking, connect sensation and action, etc)

Neurons are like gun, they fire or they fail to fire (failing to fire can cause some neurological probelm). But then how do we measure the intensity of some external change? It is decided by the number of neurons firing and frequency of firing.

There is a very small gap between axon and dendrite of next neuron called synapse. A chemical is released between them called neurotransmitter. Humans can change the amount of neurotransmitter in couple of ways to get different results:

1. Antagonist: External chemical which blocks motor neurons. Alcohol also inhibits the inhibitory neurons which are predominantly present in PFC which generally tells us what not to do like not killing anyone, keeping pants on, etc.
2. Agonist: Chemicals which increase the amount of neurotransmitter (hightened sensation, etc).

### Parts of brain

Although it seems we require brain for everything, there are few things which doesn't require any brain.

1. New born sucking
2. Withdrawal from pain
3. Vomiting

The main parts of brain are:

- Medulla: It is used for heart rate, respiration, etc.
- Cerebellum: Body balance and muscular coordination, etc.
- Hypothalamus: Feeding hunger, thirst, etc.
- Cortex: Outer layer covering brain about 2 ft. in area.
- Cortex contains frontal lobe, temporal lobe, etc.
- The two hemisphere of the brain are connected by corpus callosum.

Our brain contains topographical arrangement similar to our body. If two body parts are near, their corresponding brain part would also be very close to each other.

**Apraxia:** Brain cant provide the correct set of movement to different body part like waving, walking, etc.

**Agnosia:** When brain loses the ability to recognize faces, objects, places, etc.

**Aphasia:** Ability to not understand and produce language.

If we map every body part by the part of the brain it acquires, we get a sensory homunculus mode, which is weird to look at but tells a lot about human brain.

# Freud theory

<!-- ![https://www.sigmundfreud.net/images/sigmund-freud-photo.jpg](https://www.sigmundfreud.net/images/sigmund-freud-photo.jpg) -->
<><div className="image"><img src="https://www.sigmundfreud.net/images/sigmund-freud-photo.jpg" alt="Freud" width="500"/></div></>

There are theories which are specific to some domains of psychology, but theories of Freud and Skinner spans accross many different domains of psychology. Freud theory has a very big scope. 

Freud is consisdered to be a very hyper personality. He was a cocaine addict. He gave lot of theories, some of which are not rationale. 

One of his theory is Penis envy which seems false but also true. Its so vague that you can't prove it false and also cant prove it to be true. If we dont dive into these irrational theories and focus on other interesting rational theories he proposed then he was quite an extraordinary personality. 

### Existence of unconscious

Freud said that there is conscious and then there is unconsicous.

- He rejected the claim that you know what you are doing all the time.
- Whatever we are doing is the product of conflict between three different entities which are present in our brain.
- These three entities are:
    1. Id - It is present by birth. It is the animal part which want to eat, sleep, drink, etc. It is stupid. It only wants pleasure and it want it right now.
    2. Ego - We dont get what we want. This system ensures how to satisy the desires or how to suppress them. Origin or ego means there is a consciousness devloping.
    3. Superego - This entity tells us when something is wrong. It is also stupid but in a good way.

    There is constant struggle which happens between id and superego. Some of the struggles spills out and appears in dreams, mood, behaviour or in some cases clinical symptoms.

    There are times when the desires of Id comes out of us unconsciously. Our body takes several steps to stop this from happening and this is called defence mechanism. Few of them are:

    1. Sublimation: We can have high energy which can be related to any emotion. We use it to push ourselves in some other domain.
    2. Displacement: We can have some shameful thoughts so we express it somewhere else.
    3. Projection: I can have some impulses which I am not proud of, I can project it on someone else.
    4. Rationalisation: When we do something bad, we try to justify it by giving logical arguements which may not be correct.
    5. Regression: Returning to earlier stage of development

    Dream: Dream had a manifest content as well as latent content. Dreams are basically a way to fulfill desires. Dreams have symbolism.

### Freud theory of child development

<><div className="image"><img src="https://www.psychologynoteshq.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/freud-01.png?ezimgfmt=rs:372x288/rscb7/ng:webp/ngcb7" alt="Freud1" width="500"/></div></>

Freud believed there are five stages of child development. If there is a lack of development at a certain stage then we will be stuck there. Five stages are:

1. Oral stage: Oral trainings begins. Person who chews a lot, smokes, constantly keeps their mouth busy is due to lack of oral training.
2. Anal stage: Potty training. Ability to let go of the things. People who hold onto things, etc lack this training.
3. Phallic stage: Boys are more attached to their mother and girls to their father.
4. Latency stage: Child interacts with same sex partners because of the conclusion he/she drew out from the phallic stage. This is a long period.
5. Genital stage: We are attracted to opposite sex now.

### Criticism of Freud theory

- Theory is so vague that it cant be proved wrong neither can it be proved right.

### Unconscious examples in life

- Understanding of language
- Many likes and dislikes

# Skinner theory

## Why do have unconscious part?

1. Deception: Animals have been at the forefront when it comes to decieving other living beings. When in danger, chimpanzee hairs stands so that it can look bigger. Same happens in humans as well, we try to decieve others into beliveing that we are tougher, smarter, etc.
2. We have developed a lie detection mechanism as well to counter the decieving part. We are better liar if we believe that the lie is true. The best lie is the lie which we tell to ourselves.
3. The sinister or bad decision is better when taken with the help of unconscious part.

## Skinner theory

Skinner worked on behaviourism. Although behaviourism was already there but he bought it to the masses. Some of the key points of behaviourism are:

1. Whatever we are is because of our experience.
2. Anti mentalism: Claims about desires, unconscious is unscientific as they cant be touched or seen.
3. Behaviorist believes there are no difference between what I can do and what other person can do.

### 3 key principles of Behaviourism

1. Habitualism: Decline in the tendency to act on a stimuli due to repeated exposure to it
2. Classical conditioning: 
    - Learning of an association between one stimulus and another stimulus.
    - There are many key concepts here like generalisation, spontaneous reaction, etc.
    - One of the key experiment conducted here was **The little albert experiment**

</figure>

1. Operant conditioning: 

- Learning the relationship by what you do and how successful or unsuccessful it is.
- This conditioning is totally voluntary.
- A conditioning improves if rewarded or weakens if not.

## Controversy and criticism of Behaviourism

- We know that humans have innate knowledge and innate desires
- There is debate over how much do we know when we are born?
- Reward is not neccessay to accelerate a behaviour.
- Garcia effect: aversion to taste or smell gets associated with negative behaviour.
- Not all phobias are developed due to classical conditioning, some are innante in humans. The fear of snakes is common to both humans and chimpanzees.

# Development

## Big questions about development

1. Do we start as moral or immoral?
2. Whats the relation between child and adult? How are they related in terms of continuity?
3. How much knowledge are we born with?
    1. There are two group of thoughts around this:
        1. Empiricism: They believe that we are born empty and we learn along the way
        2. Nativism: We are born with existing structure in brain
        3. Constructivism: It is a hybrid of above two

Jean Piaget is known as the father of developmental psychology. His research field was genetic epistemelogy. He gave the theory of cognitive development.

### Piaget's theory of cognitive development

Children's are active thinkers and they constantly try to have a more advanced understanding of the world. This understanding is known as schemas.

**Schemas**: These are the framework to form an understanding. There are two ways of achieving this:

1. **Assimilation:** Absorb knowledge
2. **Accomodation:** Make space for new knowledge in already existing knowledge database.

Piaget proposed that children have a totally different **view** of the world. The development occurs as a series of stages differing in how the world looks.

## Piaget's developmental stage theory

### 1. Sensorimotor

- This is the first stage of a child's life and it happens from 0-2 years of age.
- The child have full sensory access but cant perceive it.
- He/She can see see and manipulate things without reasoning, just like a driverless car. One major thing which is absent here is the concept of object permanence.
- At all other stages, if an object is removed from our sight, we know that it still exists. But this is not the case with a child. They think that object is gone.
- Thats the reason why children from the age of 0-2 get so surprised on seeing peek-a-boo.

### 2. Preoperational

- This stage exists from age 2 to 7.
- Here the child have symbolic thoughts and they have some sort of perception of their thoughts.
- Even now they cant have higher order thoughts, maybe thats why they remain happy.
- During this phase the child is ego centric, means they cant understand that a different person can have a different view then theirs.
- They also lack the concept of conservation, means size matters more to them then numbers. If you give two glasses of milk with equal volume one larger in size and one smaller, they would say that smaller one has less milk.

### 3. Concrete operational

- This stage exists from age 7 to 12.
- Here the child have more logical thoughts, they become less ego centric.
- Although they are still not capable to reason abstractly or hypothetically. Ask someone from this age group about the meaning of true happiness?

### 4. Formal operational

- This is the final stage and then the child becomes an adult. Child develops the power of abstract and scientific reasoning here.

## Limitations of Piaget's theory

1. He never provided a theory how the children go from one stage to other.
2. His methods are not very efficient. He generally interviewed them and we cant take their answers to be 100% accurate.
3. He may be factually wrong. Some of the research show that even babies are quite smart then we think of.

 

## How do we study babies?

There are several ways in which researchers study babies.

1. The first way is using machines and scans. We scan the brain of the baby while he/she is performing some activity. We then try to deduce the logic from the brain mapping available with us.
2. Babies are born with innate talent of sucking. We can devise an experiment to judge what baby likes or dislikes by their speed, etc while sucking.
3. Babies are also born with the talent of looking at more intersting thing. We can use this to design experiment to understand what a baby mind knows.
4. There was an interesting experiment to see if babies are born with morality. It was found that around 70% of babies chose good over bad when given a choice, which might suggest that babies do have morality inbuilt.

</figure>

5. In another experiment, babies were tested whether they have the elementary sense of numbers, it was found that babies do have some sense of numbers inbuilt in them.

</figure>    

Children dont have the sense that different people can have different thoughts. They dont develop that understanding till the age of 4-4.5 years. There is another experiment conducted on children known as Sally and Anne experiment.

# Language

Language is action. Langauge is a tool which differentiate humans to other animals.

Charles Darwin: Men have the instictive tendency to speak, no other animal have this capacity.

- Every human society have language
- Creolisation: involves people who are in slave trade. Even if people are from different society, they develop a pidgin language (common communication system)
- Language is used to convey creativity
- There are around 10^130 grammatical correct sentences. It might happen that if you use a sentecne, nobody has ever said it ever before.

## Characterisation of language

### 1. Phonology

There are around 44 different sounds in english language, although there are only 26 letters. To learn a new language we need to understand the phonies of the language. It is quite astonishing that a listener's mind is able to tell where a word in a sentence ends. Our mind automatically do it for us. Our brain is wired so to segment the words of the speech hence extracting a meaning out of it. If we hear any new language, our brain can even process where a word ends.

### 2. Morphology

This deals with words. The smallest meaningful unit of language is known as morpheme like -ing, come,-ed, etc. An average english speaker knows about 80000 morphemes.

### 3. Syntax

rules of language, 

## Language acquisition

Noam Chomsky says that development of language should not be seen as development of language but growth. Some researchers believe that the language is important for abstract thoughts, which seems to be not true based on some recent experiments. The language acquition happens in babies in following steps:

1. **Born-4 months**
    1. Babies start to understand the melody of language.
    2. They become sensitive to phonemes. It is found that babies are sensitive to phonemes of many languages.
2. **4-7 months**
    1. Babies starts to babble. By birth deaf babbles with the help of the movement of their hands.
3. **7-12 month**
    1. Babies speak their first words. 
    2. At this stage they also become sensitive to words. They start responding to them.
4. **12-18 months**
    1. Babies can produce sentences upto 2 words.
    2. They start learning morphemes like is,a,the,etc.

It is seen that young age is best for learning new language. Even if an adult person spends considerable amount of time learning a second language, he/she might not be able to get fluent.

# Perception, Attention and Memory

# Perception

Our brain percieves things very fast, lot faster then a computer. It all begins with eye, but even then there are too many question. It is believed that brain understands things by these three ways:

### Perception of brightness

Our brain automatically brightens an object in light and darken an object in light. This can create an illusion in some cases.

[Adelson's Same Color Illusion - BrainHQ from Posit Science](https://www.brainhq.com/brain-resources/brain-teasers/adelsons-same-color-illusion/)

### Perception of depth

Brain is capable of understanding depth. If we see a small object growing in size, we automatically realise that it is moving towards us.

[Shepard's Rotated Tables](https://michaelbach.de/ot/sze-ShepardTables/)

### Perception of objects

Our brain is very good in recognising patterns. By recognising these patterns we are able to differetiate different objects which are visible.

# Attention

Our brain is capable of paying attention to which it feels neccessary or oblidged to do.

### Stroop effect

In psychology, the Stroop effect is the delay in reaction time between congruent and incongruent stimuli. The effect has been used to create a psychological test that is widely used in clinical practice and investigation.

This video tells that we are not very attentive in our day to day life.

</figure>

# Memory

Memory is complicated. The memory can use below mentioned terms:

1. **Explicit memory:** It includes known facts like capital of country, date of birth, etc.
2. **Implicit memory:** We dont remember it consciously like driving, breathing, etc.
3. **Semantic**: It can be again like capital of country or we can say known facts.
4. **Episodic**: We remember certain episodes of our life like our happiest moment, etc.
5. **Encoding**: Information stored in head
6. **Storage**: Space where we store the information
7. **Retrieval**: The process of extracting memory out of storage.
8. **Recall**: We remember certain things which are triggered due to some sensory actions.
9. **Recognition**: Like we instantly know the name of the person, etc.

### Memory storage

<!-- ![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images-archive-read-only/wp-content/uploads/sites/902/2015/02/23224848/CNX_Psych_08_01_Atkinson.jpg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images-archive-read-only/wp-content/uploads/sites/902/2015/02/23224848/CNX_Psych_08_01_Atkinson.jpg) -->
<><div className="image"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images-archive-read-only/wp-content/uploads/sites/902/2015/02/23224848/CNX_Psych_08_01_Atkinson.jpg" alt="Storage" width="500"/></div></>

1. **Sensory memory:** These are the memory which are there due to some sensory triggers. Like we might not be paying attention but if someone asks were we listening, we actually go back to our auditory memory and try retrieving the information.
2. **Short term memory:** This is a memory which holds information for a very short duration. The golden number given to store information is 7 +/- 2 chunks (basic unit of storing information). We need to rehearse continuously to refresh and keep the memory. 
3. **Long term memory:** This is which is encoded in our brain. It stays for a long period of time but it also needs to get refreshed.

### How to get things to long term memory?

1. Depth of processing sends information to Long term memory: If we have deeper analysis of knowledge then it is more likely to be stored in long term memory
2. Mnemonics: Make connections among chunks
3. Understanding: If we have the right context of our memory, we are more likely to hold it for long duration

### Remembering

How to get information out of memory?

1. Retrieval cues: We can have some story associated with the memory. We can use that story to extract the information
2. Compatibility principle: We remeber information when we try to recover information in the same context we stored them.
3. Searching strategy: We remember things if we change our search starategy like trying recovering from different angles.

### Failures of memory

1. Why do we forget? 
    1. Because memory are physical things so they fade overtime
    2. Because of interference: New information kind of overwrites
    3. Change of retrieval cues
2. Forgetting due to brain damage (amnesia)
    1. Retrograde amnesia: loss of memory prior to stroke or accident
    2. Anterograde amnesia: lose the capacity to form the memory

</figure>

### False memories

Why are memories are sometimes distorted?

1. Expectations: When we increase the expectations
2. Leading questions: Questions can sometime fill in the story so to make the questions correct.
3. Hypnosis: We try creating a strory
4. Repressed memory: Memories which are repressed can be turned into false story
5. Flashbulb memory: Memories associated to some disaster can be manipulated by the brain

# Emotions and Social

### Doctorine of Physicalism

It states that everything is physical. It is closely related to materialism.

### Where do complex things come from?

Suppose you are walking on a path and your foot gets hurt by a stone, then you might ask the question as to how the stone got there. Then you might get the answer that the stone could have been there since eternity. But suppose you would have found a watch, then the answer would not have been the same as watch is very complex than all other things there. Similarly, we can say the same thing about human organs. This is known as **argument from design.**

- **Problem of creationism:** It we believe that we were created by some external entity like god or aliens then it leads to following problem:
    1. Pushes back the actual question
    2.  There has been proof of evolution
    3. Poor design, some body parts are not correctly designed like blind spot in eyes, etc.
- **Natural Selection:** Given by Charles darwin. Evolution was known long before he came but he showed why its there. This is how it happens in brief:
    1. Random variation
    2. Random variation gives rise to differences in survival and reproduction and gets passed from generation to generation
    3. Lastly, the perfect structure is formed
- The brain is the product of evolution

### Misconception about evolution and psychology

- Natural selection should have caused humans and animals to spread their genes.
    1. This is a wrong assumption.
    2. There is a difference between ultimate causation and proximate causation.
    3. Evolution did have caused us to feel hunger, etc which is proximate causation.
- Everything we do have adaptive significance.
    1. Color vision is adaptive change
    2. Love of TV, chocolates, etc is accident
    3. Pleasure we get from music or art or humour is still in research as to find why we like it
- Life is possible without emotions
    1. This is completely wrong. Emotions are fundamental to humans

### Facial expressions

- We are more prone to smile when we are happy and we want other people to know it.
- Smiles are social symbol.
- There are different types of smile
    1. Happiness smile (Duchenne smile, more to do with eyes)
    2. Greeting smile (kind of fake, more to do below the nose)
    3. Coy smile (awkward, nervous)
    4. Babies have the tendency to find the difference between the types of smile
    5. Couples who have more Duchenne smile are happier

### Fear

- Its a social emotion.
- People have fear of snakes, heights, less space,etc. But we never meet someone who is afraid of cars or electric shop.
- It is found that children are afraid of spiders and snakes from a very young age. The classical conditioning cant explain it, but the main reason is evolution.
- Emotions are very hard to fake.
- Study of fear can explain how evolution have affected our emotions.

### Kinship and Attachment

- Every animal want to have children. It is loosely related to survival of the fittest which means that animals are always in a tussle to survive either by intelligence or power. Then how do the kindness exist in our personality? There is no use of kindness in the cruel world.
- We have evolved to be nice to our kin.
- We are most attached to our children as they are the closest who are related to us and vie versa. The psychology of attachement poses two questions:
    1. How parent react to children? Adults are innately attracted to babies. We like the features of a babies face.
    2. How children reacts to parent? Children are attracted to anyone who takes care of them. Conditiong and rewarding can be one of the reason (Cupboard theory by Skinner) or Innate attachemnt theory by Bowlby. Children search for a sense of security more than any other things which is explained by this video.

        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OrNBEhzjg8I" title="YouTube video player" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowFullScreen></iframe>

We are nice to non kin as well. How did this kindness came into us?

Reciprocal altruism: We are more likely to help someone who help us

Sometimes we make decisions which appears to be irrational on surface but are actually rational. For eg: The ultimatum game

# Social

### Social priming

We are influenced by factors outside of our control

### Self

- Spotlight effect - We tend to think everyone notices us
- Lakewobegon effect - Suppose in a class, students are asked individually as to how attentive they are. Most of them will say a value above 50 (on a scale of 0-100). Everyone thinks they are above average.
- Self serving bias: We tend to attribute positive things to ourselves rather than negative things. We think positive result are our own doing but negative result is due to external factors.
- Cognitive dissonance theory: When we experience internal inconsistency, we feel unpleasant. We want to get rid of that feeling.
    1. We avoid incosistent information. Humans generally want what they think to be true. Most people who go for second opinion try to get a feedback of their liking.
    2. Insufficient justification effect: If we dont have enough justification for a doing, we might change our opinion about it.

### Attribution theory

- Why a behaviour occurs?
- We intuitivly thinks of others action as part of their personality
- We have the tendency to see actors as the character they play

### Liking

- Why do we like other people?
- Apart from noral traits like honesty, kindness, etc there are some psychological factors as well.
- Familiarity is important. More we see something, more we like it. People who live close or daily see each other, develop a sense of familiarity and then liking. This is known as Mere-exposure effect.
- Similarity also attracts.
- Attractive people tends to be smarter, wiser, moral, get more marks
- Mathew effect: Rich gets rich and poor gets poor. Attractive people gets everything else as well.
- First impressions are very very important.
    1. First impressions are formed very quickly called thin slices.
- What effects do our perception of other people have on other people? This also plays a significant role.
- Self fulfilling prophecies: When our belief and expectations create a reality or influence our or others behaviour. Also known as pygmalion effect.

# Differences, Clinical psychology and Happiness

The main questions are:

1. How we are different from other people?
2. Why we are different from other people?

The main difference in 2 persons are:

### Personality

To measure the personality we use reliability and validity.

Harrower-Erickson Multiple Choice Rorschach Test is a test which was used earlier to test personality, although there is no way to test its validity.

[Inkblot test: Harrower-Erickson Multiple Choice Rorschach Test](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/HEMCR/)

The big five personality factors:

1. Neurotocism - Stability (N)
2. Extrovert - Introvert (E)
3. Openness to experience - Non openness (O)
4. Agreeableness - Antagonism (A)
5. Conscientiousness - Undirectedness (C)

This is the Big five test (OCEAN) and it is stable and there is a way to validate it.

### Intelligence

People have different opinion about what intelligence means. Charles Spearmen defined intelligence as two factors, i.e. general intelligence (g, accounts for similarity) and specific ability (s, accounts for differences).

### Behavioural genetics

We are different because of these regions:

1. Genes and environment
2. Nature vs Nurture

The findings of behavioural genetics:

1. High heritability in all cases when talking about psychology
    1. The flynn effect: We use same scale to test IQs for people of different generations. If we dont use the same scale, then we can see that the average IQ is rising rapidly in the last 70-100 years.
2. Rest of the variance in a group comes from non shared environment.

### Parenting

Shared environment does'nt matter. Parents dont matter in IQ, they just impact the hereditory part. Their parenting technique does'nt matter. Peers matter more than the parents.
