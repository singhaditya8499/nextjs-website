Hello there! My name is Aditya Singh. I am a pantomath  and a <b>Software Developer Engineer at Amazon</b> working in Global Mile organisation. 
    As the name suggest, I work on creating solutions to optimize the global movement of small parcels. I have the strong desire of learning new things. 
    I am driven by these two quotes: 
    <p className="quote">“We have two lives, and the second begins when we realize we only have one.”</p>
    <p className="whoSaid">~ Confucius</p>
    <p className="quote">"The unexamined life is not worth living".</p>
    <p className="whoSaid">~ Socrates</p> 
    I am a big football fanatic, talking about the real one (:P) and a Real Madrid supporter (even if we dont have Ronaldo).
    In my spare time, I read non fictional books, read and learn about new and innovative tech. 
    Recently, I have developed a taste for hip hop music, thanks to my cousins! I love stand up comedy and play chess occasionally (not so good but working on it).
